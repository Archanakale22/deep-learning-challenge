Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to create a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras to predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit organization. The model aimed to achieve at least 75% accuracy in classification.
Results 

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?

•	The target variable is IS_SUCCESSFUL from the dataset.
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
•	All columns except IS_SUCCESSFUL, EIN, and NAME were used as features.
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
•	EIN and NAME columns were removed as they were identifiers and not useful for prediction.

 Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
•	The initial model had 2 hidden layers with 8 neurons in the first layer and 5 neurons in the second layer. REL activation function was used for the hidden layers and Sigmoid activation for the output layer.
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
•	The model achieved approximately 73% accuracy, falling short of the 75% target.
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
•	Increased the number of hidden layers.
•	Adjusted the number of neurons in each layer.
•	Tested different activation functions (ReLU, Tanh, etc.).
•	Conducted feature selection and removal of irrelevant columns.

Summary of Results

The deep learning model achieved a respectable accuracy of around 73% in predicting the success of funding applications. 
While this is below the 75% target, it demonstrates the model's capability to learn and make predictions based on the provided features.
Further optimization through hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering could potentially improve the accuracy.
Using a Different Model Approach

To potentially solve the same classification problem of predicting funding success, a different model approach could be considered:
Random Forest Classifier
Why Random Forest?
•	Random Forests are robust against overfitting and can handle large datasets with many features.
•	They can capture complex relationships between features and target variable due to the ensemble of decision trees.
•	Feature importance can be easily extracted, aiding in understanding which variables are most influential in predicting funding success.

Implementation Strategy:
•	Preprocess data similarly, ensuring all features are relevant.
•	Train a Random Forest Classifier using default parameters initially.
•	Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search or randomized search to optimize model performance.
•	Evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure it meets or exceeds the desired performance metrics.

Conclusion:

By employing a Random Forest Classifier, Alphabet Soup could potentially improve prediction accuracy beyond the 73% achieved with the deep learning model. 
This approach leverages the strengths of ensemble learning and can provide insights into feature importance, aiding in better decision-making regarding funding applications.
